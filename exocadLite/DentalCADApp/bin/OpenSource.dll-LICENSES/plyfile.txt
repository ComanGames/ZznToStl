 The interface routines for reading and writing PLY polygon files.
 
  Greg Turk, February 1994
  
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   
	A PLY file contains a single polygonal _object_.
	
	 An object is composed of lists of _elements_.  Typical elements are
	 vertices, faces, edges and materials.
	 
	  Each type of element for a given object has one or more _properties_
	  associated with the element type.  For instance, a vertex element may
	  have as properties the floating-point values x,y,z and the three unsigned
	  chars representing red, green and blue.
